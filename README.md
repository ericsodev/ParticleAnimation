# Particle Animation
Render an animation simulating realistic particle interactions.
## Implementation
The goal is to observe differences between discrete/continuous collision checking so both will be implemented.

For particle-particle interactions, "sweep and prune" will first be implemented then using K-D Trees to compare performance.

## Status
- Needs to be refactored to implement the above features
## Example
